# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I honestly did not know the JavaScript Learning Tutor was a thing until right now as I am filling this out. I'm sure it would have been useful if I used to earlier.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> I don't have any suggestions at this time. 


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> I did not receive any help from classmates but I did do a good amount of researching how the readline function works, particularly from nodejs.org.


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> 2 hours. Most of the time was spent getting my setup together for this assignment/course.


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> This assignment overall was probably about a 5 or 6 but since I have no experience with javascript I would probably rate it at a 7. 


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> Any problems I had in this assignment were pretty easy to solve once my setup was good to go. I would say this assignment doesn't need any improvement.
